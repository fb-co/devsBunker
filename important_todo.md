# Before-Deployment

## High Priority

-   [ ] LOGO

-   [ ] Auto-update profile pics when you upload a new one

-   [x] Selecting more than five images while creating a new post graphically shows it in the menu, but only uploads the first five

-   [x] Make the Post thumbnail default placeholder image actully work

-   [ ] Some user feedback when creating a post, logging out, etc

-   [ ] Prepare foreign profile page for deployment

    -   [ ] Shoulnt give option to change desc if its not your own profile page

    -   [ ] Get rid of email option for foreign user

    -   [ ] Spruce up the styling or functionality since it seems a little "empty"

-   [ ] Highlight search phrases on post searches

-   [ ] @focus and @blur does not work on iphone making a lot of the dropdowns and focus based menues not work

## Low Priority

-   [ ] Optimize notification bell, and make a standardized component (ill do this)

-   [ ] Redundant navigation errors for some reason in the User pages (try clicking around the tabs a bit and you should see them)

-   [ ] Right after you create a post and it hot reloads, you can't like or save it until you refresh (doesn't show graphically)

-   [ ] Remove all follow buttons for yourself since they don't work it can be confusing

-   [ ] Post view should have static left and right content (maybe)
