# Contributing to devsBunker

Thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to devsBunker. 

## Code of Conduct

Anyone can contribute to this project but there are some standards

### Standards

Keep a positive behavior, be respectful and accept citicism.

As for now, all pull requests will be analyzed by @f0lg0 and @JacopoFB. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

We don't really have a coding style, camelCase is always preferred though.

## What should I know before I get started?

Please take a look at the [run](https://github.com/fb-co/devsBunker#run) section in our README.md

devsBunker has been built with Vue.js, Node.js, GraphQL and MongoDB. Any other major improvement must go under maintainers' approval.

## How can I contribute?

Contribute by simply making pull requests **ONLY** in the **Master** (dev) branch, don't ever touch **prod**.

You can also create GitHub Issues to report bugs, plan ideas and ask for new features.

### ToDo List

- [ ] bug: profile pictures are not correctly displayed in the profile page on mobile clients
- [ ] bug: some notifications aren't being sent properly (Work In Progress, please ignore)


## Thanks

Thanks for your interest in devsBunker!
